## Demo Script Tips

### Do's
- ✅ Start with the problem, not the technology
- ✅ Show real data, not mock data
- ✅ Explain the user benefits clearly
- ✅ Demonstrate the decentralized nature
- ✅ Highlight the technical sophistication

### Don'ts
- ❌ Don't get lost in technical details
- ❌ Don't show empty states without context
- ❌ Don't rush through the wallet connection
- ❌ Don't ignore error states
- ❌ Don't forget to explain the business model

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Wallet not connecting**: Check MetaMask installation and network
2. **No data showing**: Ensure you're on a supported network
3. **Transaction failing**: Check gas fees and wallet balance
4. **Slow loading**: Check internet connection and try refreshing

### Backup Plans
- Have screenshots ready for each section
- Prepare a video recording as backup
- Have a test wallet with demo data ready
- Know the key talking points by heart
