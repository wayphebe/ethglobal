üîß GaiaGrid Web3 MVP Development Blog - Round 2: Error Resolution & Network Enhancement
üìÖ Development Session Summary
Date: October 25, 2025
Duration: ~2 hours
Focus: Console Error Resolution & Multi-Network Support
Status: ‚úÖ Successfully Completed
üéØ Session Objectives
After the initial Web3 MVP implementation, we encountered two critical console errors that needed immediate resolution:
Circular Structure Error in localStorage operations
Unsupported Chain ID Error when connecting to Ethereum Mainnet
The goal was to create a robust, error-free Web3 experience that gracefully handles multiple blockchain networks.
üêõ Issues Identified & Resolved
Issue #1: Circular Structure Error
Console Error: Converting circular structure to JSON
Root Cause: The saveConnectionState function was attempting to serialize complex objects containing circular references when saving to localStorage.
Solution Implemented:
// Before (problematic)
localStorage.setItem('gaiagrid-wallet-connection', JSON.stringify({
  account,
  chainId,
  walletType
}))

// After (fixed)
const connectionData = {
  account: String(account),
  chainId: Number(chainId),
  walletType: String(walletType)
}

try {
  localStorage.setItem('gaiagrid-wallet-connection', JSON.stringify(connectionData))
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to save connection state:', error)
}
Key Improvements:
‚úÖ Explicit type conversion to primitives
‚úÖ Try-catch error handling
‚úÖ Prevents circular reference serialization
Issue #2: Unsupported Chain ID Error
Console Error: Unsupported chain ID: 1
Root Cause: The application only supported testnet chains (Sepolia, Polygon, Arbitrum Sepolia) but users were connecting with Ethereum Mainnet (Chain ID: 1).
Solution Implemented:
1. Expanded Network Support
// Added support for 5 networks total
export const supportedChains = [mainnet, sepolia, polygon, arbitrum, arbitrumSepolia] as const

// Updated network configurations
export const networkConfig = {
  [mainnet.id]: {
    name: 'Ethereum Mainnet',
    rpcUrl: 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your-infura-key',
    blockExplorer: 'https://etherscan.io',
    // ... configuration
  },
  // ... other networks
}
2. Graceful Error Handling
// Before (throwing errors)
export function getContractAddress(chainId: number, contractName: string) {
  const addresses = contractAddresses[chainId]
  if (!addresses) {
    throw new Error(`Unsupported chain ID: ${chainId}`) // ‚ùå Hard error
  }
}

// After (graceful degradation)
export function getContractAddress(chainId: number, contractName: string) {
  const addresses = contractAddresses[chainId]
  if (!addresses) {
    console.warn(`Unsupported chain ID: ${chainId}. Please switch to a supported network.`)
    return '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000' // ‚úÖ Safe fallback
  }
}
3. Real-time Network Validation
// Added to connectWallet function
const supportedChainIds = [1, 11155111, 137, 42161, 421614]
if (!supportedChainIds.includes(chainIdNum)) {
  setError(`Unsupported network (Chain ID: ${chainIdNum}). Please switch to Ethereum, Polygon, or Arbitrum.`)
  setIsConnecting(false)
  return
}

üìù Code Quality Improvements
Error Handling Patterns
// Consistent error handling pattern
try {
  // Operation that might fail
  const result = riskyOperation()
  return result
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Operation failed:', error)
  // Provide fallback or user guidance
  return fallbackValue
}
Type Safety
// Explicit type conversion for localStorage
const connectionData = {
  account: String(account),
  chainId: Number(chainId),
  walletType: String(walletType)
}
User Experience Focus
// User-friendly error messages
setError(`Unsupported network (Chain ID: ${chainIdNum}). Please switch to Ethereum, Polygon, or Arbitrum.`)
